## Thread Pool Implementation Task List

1. **Implement a thread-safe task queue for submitting and retrieving tasks.**  
   Create a data structure (such as a queue) to hold tasks waiting to be executed. Ensure multiple threads can safely add or remove tasks without data corruption or race conditions.

2. **Design synchronization mechanisms to ensure safe concurrent access (e.g., using locks or semaphores).**  
   Use synchronization primitives (like mutexes, locks, or semaphores) to protect shared resources (such as the task queue) and prevent concurrent access issues among threads.

3. **Create a thread pool manager that initializes a fixed (or dynamic) number of worker threads.**  
   Develop a component responsible for creating and managing a set number of worker threads. Decide if the pool size is fixed or can grow/shrink based on workload.

4. **Implement the worker thread logic to continuously fetch and execute tasks from the queue.**  
   Write the main loop for worker threads: repeatedly take a task from the queue and execute it. Make sure threads handle waiting when no tasks are available.

5. **Handle the scenario when the task queue is full (e.g., block, drop, or reject new tasks).**  
   Establish a policy for what to do if the queue reaches its capacity, such as blocking the submitting thread, rejecting new tasks, or dropping tasks.

6. **Provide a public API for submitting tasks to the thread pool.**  
   Design a simple and clear interface for users to submit new tasks to the pool, ensuring safe communication with the queue.

7. **Implement error handling for tasks that throw exceptions or fail during execution.**  
   Safely catch exceptions or errors in worker threads so that one failing task does not crash the worker or the entire pool. Optionally, expose failure information to the caller.

8. **Allow for asynchronous task results (e.g., via future or promise objects).**  
   Enable users to obtain results from submitted tasks after execution, using constructs like futures or promises for asynchronous result retrieval.

9. **Implement a graceful shutdown mechanism to cleanly stop all threads and process remaining tasks.**  
   Provide a way to shut down the thread pool, ensuring that no tasks are left unprocessed and all threads terminate properly.

10. **Add support for task prioritization (optional).**  
    (Optional) Enhance your queue to support different priorities so that higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones.

11. **Write tests to ensure thread safety, correct execution, and proper shutdown.**  
    Create comprehensive tests to verify the poolâ€™s correctness under normal and edge-case scenarios, including concurrent submissions, shutdown procedures, and error handling.
